      Higher-order components (sometimes higher-order functions) are functions
      which return a React component while enhancing its capabilities. They are
      often used as a way to factorise code and avoid repetitions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is a higher-order component (HOC) in its smallest form (not doing
      much, really):
    </p>

    <Code language="jsx">{`const MyFirstHOC = WrappedComponent => {
  const foo = 'bar'

  return props => {
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} foo={foo} />
  }
}`}</Code>

    <p>
      In this folder, we provided a <code>Trackable</code> component that logs
      things in the browser console (where an actual tracker would record user
      behaviour). This very page is wrapped by the <code>Trackable</code>{' '}
      component. Open your console and try clicking around to see it.
    </p>

    <SectionTitle text="Exercise — Higher-order component for viewport width" />

    <p>
      Write a higher-order function that provides the viewport width to the
      wrapped component as a <code>viewportWidth</code> prop. Do not forget to
      remove the listeners when the component unmounts! Help yourself with the{' '}
      <code>Trackable</code> component if you need.
    </p>

    <Example live>
      <ViewportWidthDisplay />
    </Example>

    <p>
      When you’re done, make sure it reacts to viewport width’ changes as well!
    </p>

export default Trackable(Page)
